# ðŸ“Œ Credit Risk Modeling & EPS Prediction

Revising the current credit lending strategy of bank using machine learning

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning solution for credit risk assessment and EPS (Earnings Per Share) prediction in the banking sector.
It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and web deployment using Flask, allowing users to input financial metrics and instantly receive EPS predictions.


## Dataset Description:-


### 1. Bureau Dataset (case_study1.xlsx)

Contains customer credit history information from external credit bureaus.

#### Key features:

   ->PROSPECTID â€“ unique customer ID (used to merge datasets).

   ->Age_Oldest_TL / Age_Newest_TL â€“ age of oldest/newest trade lines.

   ->MARITALSTATUS, EDUCATION, GENDER â€“ demographic details.

   ->Recent payment, delinquency, and enquiry details.

   ->Purpose: Gives a risk profile based on past credit behavior.

### 2. Internal Product Dataset (case_study2.xlsx)
  
  Contains bankâ€™s internal data about its own products and customer engagement.

#### Key features:

   ->Product enquiry counts and recent product interactions (last_prod_enq2, first_prod_enq2).

   ->Income details like NETMONTHLYINCOME.

   ->Employment details like Time_With_Curr_Empr.

   ->Purpose: Adds in-house insights about a customerâ€™s interaction with the bank.



## Project Workflow


### 1. Data Understanding & Preparation

  ->Merged Bureau Dataset and Internal Product Dataset using a common identifier.

  ->Handled missing values, outliers, and invalid entries.

  ->Removed low-quality features based on missing thresholds.

  ->Performed categorical feature analysis using Chi-square test and numerical feature selection using ANOVA & Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

### 2. Feature Engineering

  ->Label encoded ordinal variables such as Education Level.

  ->One-Hot encoded nominal categorical variables (Gender, Marital Status, Product Enquiries).

  ->Applied scaling for numerical variables like Age, Income, Time with Employer.

### 3. Model Building

  ->Implemented Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree classifiers to predict credit risk tiers (P1, P2, P3, P4).

  ->Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for optimal accuracy.

  ->Evaluated models on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes.

  ->Selected XGBoost as the best performer based on multi-class metrics.

### 4. EPS Prediction Web App

  ->Built a Flask application to serve the trained EPS prediction model (eps_v1.sav).

  ->Designed a user-friendly HTML form for entering key financial metrics (ROCE, CASA, Operating Profit, Expenses, etc.).

  ->Deployed locally to provide instant EPS predictions.

### 5. Deployment & Feedback

  ->Configured model to be retrainable with new data/feedback.

  ->Designed workflow for continuous improvement based on real-time user interaction.
